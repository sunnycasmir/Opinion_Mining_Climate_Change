# Opinion Mining on Climate Change Using Tweets

This project focuses on opinion mining to analyze users' sentiments regarding climate change using tweets sourced from X (formerly known as Twitter). By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we aim to extract, categorize, and understand the diverse perspectives and sentiments expressed by users on this critical global issue.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project comprises 35,007 rows and 9 columns, offering a rich repository of information for sentiment analysis. Each row represents a unique tweet, and the columns provide various attributes of the tweets, including:

- **User**: Unique identifier for each tweet.
- **Username**: Twitter handle of the user who posted the tweet.
- **UTC Date**: The actual date of the tweet.
- **Tweet**: The actual text of the  tweet.
- **Binders**:
- **Permalink** The individual tweeter links
- **Retweet Count**: Number of times the tweet has been retweeted.
- **Likes Count**: Number of likes the tweet has received.
- **Tweet value**: Values assigned to the Tweet.


## Objectives

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify tweets into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
- **Topic Modeling**: Identify key themes and topics discussed in the context of climate change.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the tweet text by removing stopwords, special characters, and URLs.
2. **Sentiment Classification**: Use machine learning models and NLP techniques to classify the sentiment of each tweet.
3. **Visualization**: Create visual representations of the sentiment distribution, key topics, and geographical trends.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide insights into public opinion on climate change, helping policymakers, researchers, and activists understand the prevailing sentiments and drive informed decisions and actions. By harnessing the power of social media data, we can better grasp the global conversation around climate change.
